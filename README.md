I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

In building this interactive dashboard, I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu that displays the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. Additionally, I made a bubble chart that displays each of the samples. Each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object displays an individual's demographic information in the Demographic Info panel when the user selects a test subject's ID number. Finally, the coup de gr√¢ce of the interactive dashboard is that it updates all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
